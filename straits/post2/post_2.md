# China's New Silk Road and The Revenge of History

In 2013, Chinese Premier Xi Jingping announced the largest infrastructure investment effort in history, dubbing this grand project the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. These initiatives aim at large investments by an economically resurgent China to bring forth dams, bridges, and ports throughout the Indian Ocean littoral and Eurasian heartland. The name is more than apt, as China is trying to do no less than recreate the Silk Road of the past that catalysed the transfer of goods and ideas between East and West and served as an unmatched tool for soft and hard power projection for the state that controlled it, like the Mongol Empire. While the Silk Road sprung organically, the modern Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a deliberate decision by China - inspired by the past - to enhance its influence in its immediate periphery and potentially extend it across Eurasia. BRI will do this primarily via economic investments that enhance integration and catalyse trade. However, as BRI ramps up, China’s neighbours rightfully worry about safeguarding their sovereignty against the negative consequences of its foray into regional development. Such consequences include excessive Chinese influence upon participant countries and debt traps from grandiose projects stuck in quagmires such as the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka.


To adequately discuss BRI, we must start with its historical inspiration, the Silk Road. The Silk Road was an extensive network of trade routes connecting the Chinese heartlands to the Mediterranean from the 2nd century BCE to the 18th. Initially spurred into existence by the Chinese monopoly on silk manufacture under the Han dynasty, the Silk Road gradually evolved into a catalyst for the exchange of goods and ideas across East and West.

It was also an engine of soft power projection; the Chinese monopoly of silk, which remained the most coveted luxury in Eurasia for centuries, did much to elevate the perception of its civilisation. The contemporary preponderance of Buddhism - a South Asian faith - in East Asia also owes significant thanks to the Silk Road, which served as a catalyst for the transmissions of Mahayana, Theravada, and Tibetan Buddhism throughout Eurasia. Central Asia, although primarily ethnically Turkic today with the exception of Tajikistan (which is primarily Iranian), presents a unique mélange of Islamic, Persian, and Turkic traditions. Islam is the dominant faith of the region, yet Nowruz - the pre Islamic Persian New Year festival - is still celebrated in each of these countries. The name has also remained almost unchanged, being Nowruz in Turkmen, Navr’oz in Uzbek, Нооруз (Nooruz) in Kyrgyz, and Наурыз (Naurız) in Kazakh. Christianity also benefited from the Silk Road, reaching the apex of the Mongol Empire with Sorghaghtani Beki, Genghis Khan’s daughter in law who took key policy decisions in the 13th century to usher in a more cosmopolitan Mongol Empire. Although herself Nestorian Christian, Sorghaghtani Beki instilled tolerance in her sons who later  - as Great Khans of the largest contiguous empire in history - promulgated the notion of state over religion from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. This control over the entire Silk Road and its vibrant flow of goods and ideas benefitted the Mongol economy immensely. The Mongols in turn reciprocated by using their authority to catalyse trade and integration across Eurasia - for instance through their efficient postal services. This illustrates the remarkable symbiosis between the Silk Road and Pax Mongolica, and crucially the immense soft and hard power possibilities that leveraging control over the entire Silk Road could give.

Given the immense geopolitical potential of connecting East and West and controlling that connection, it is hardly a surprise that a resurgent China would wish to (re)mobilise the Silk Road to expand its influence across Eurasia. Today’s China enjoys benefits that its Han predecessor did not, such as controlling ~20% of global manufacturing output and being the key node in global supply chains. All this gives China’s BRI project immense potential. With this in mind, it is easy to identify two critical objectives of BRI. The first is stated clearly by one of Beijing’s mouthpieces: “[BRI] aims to promote … highly efficient allocation of resources and deep integration of markets by enhancing connectivity of Asian, European, and African continents and their adjacent seas”. That there are economic benefits possible from such integration is certainly true, as evidenced by the positive impacts of Pax Mongolica and the Silk Road. Notable also is the inclusion of Africa, which indicates China’s ambition. As we will see, the Chinese are very serious about outdoing the Mongols and getting deeply involved in Africal. The second objective, which China routinely downplays but analysts repeatedly emphasise, is the expansion of its influence by using BRI as a conduit for soft and hard power projection. In this respect, we must be careful to not assign malignant intentions to China, as western analysts are prone to do. Beijing is simply pursuing a course of action expected of a civilisation state with a long and proud history riding a resurgence back to the upper echelon of the global order.
