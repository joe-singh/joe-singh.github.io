# Geopolitics
  
Geopolitics, the study of of how geography impacts international relations, interests me a lot. 
I spent the vast majority of my childhood/early years by the Straits of Malacca and Hormuz, the most important energy chokepoints
in the world. Because of this, I was a first hand witness to the important role of geography in the rise of two world cities - Singapore and Dubai.   

Here, I'll indulge my wannabe strategic planner trying to make sense of trends that I learn about. From the backlash against
globalisation to the rise of China, the world is very quickly becoming a more interesting place again and making geopolitics an 
indispensable tool for making sense of all the chaos out there.
