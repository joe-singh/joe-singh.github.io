# Ars Geopolitica - A Geopolitics Diary

Welcome to <em>Ars Geopolitica</em>, a small corner of the internet where I take a break from physics and turn my attention to the broader world.
The post Cold War liberal world order is cracking at the seams
as longterm geopolitical trends, such as the backlash against globalisation and rise of China, come to maturity. The COVID crisis
has simply accelerated the maturation of these trends.

In this uncertain time, the importance of geopolitics is apparent once again. Despite technological advances, geography remains a fundamental constraint on
what states can and cannot do. Despite framing the context in which political decisions are made - particularly in the realm of foreign affairs -
geopolitics remains conspicuously absent from everyday conversations unlike plain old politics.

This blog was inspired by my having lived a majority of my life in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region, and a
majority of that majority living right by the critical chokepoints at the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca, which allowed me to witness the impact of
geopolitics up close.
