# On Rivers in America and Asia

<div class="straits">
Rivers do not typically come to mind when one considers what factors fuel economic prosperity. Instead, it is more common to prescribe a recipe including innovation, entrepreneurship and efficient bureaucracies backed by responsible governments. When one examines prosperous states throughout history, the ubiquity of this recipe becomes clear. However, another commonality becomes apparent -- the presence of rivers within their borders. Many great civilisations of antiquity coalesced first around prominent rivers, such as the Egyptians around the Nile c. 3000 BCE and the Akkadians around the Tigris & Euphrates c. 2000 BCE. Rivers such as the Danube and Rhine were undoubtedly a catalyst for Europe’s mercantilism, while the contemporary US enjoys the benefit of the Missouri and Mississippi.

Rivers lead to prosperity for a variety of reasons. An obvious one is that rivers catalyse agricultural activity. The Nile’s annual flood reinvigorated the soil on its banks and made it fertile. The fertility of the soil and the Nile’s predictable flooding pattern made agriculture so efficient that Egypt remained the breadbasket of the Mediterranean for three thousand years. A second vital factor is that navigable rivers greatly boost commercial activity. Navigable here means that a river is large enough to allow cargo carrying vessels to sail on it. The US has been blessed with more than 40,000 km of navigable rivers, and this has played a key role in US economic prosperity. US waterways ship around $70 billion worth of goods annually, worth more than the GDP of over 100 other nations.
