# Shor's Algorithm

<div>
Suppose we want to factor $N$ into its prime 
factors. The inefficient classical way to do this
is a brute force approach that is exponential.
The most efficient classical algorithm for factoring
numbers is the [general number field sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve) that
takes sub-exponential time. Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that
can do this $\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\log N\right)^3\right)$ where 
N is the size of the integer.
