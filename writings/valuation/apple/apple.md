# The Fragility of Separation of Powers

<div class='straits'>
Iâ€™ve recently taken the plunge into the murky waters of the stock market. One of the first companies that I wanted to look at as a serious investment was Apple. Apple initially caught my eye since I realised I am an exceptionally loyal customer of theirs and I figured if I could invest so much into their phones and computers, I should definitely take a look at their stock. There were two other reasons I wanted to look at Apple as the potential first entrant in my portfolio.Firstly, Apple is the largest company in the world overflowing with cash and unlikely to fail, and at the same time it is one of the biggest players in the dynamic technology sector. Combining these two, it seems like Apple would be a nice moderate blend of risk and reward for a meager graduate student. Here, I attempt to piece together a story for where I think the company is heading and translate that into a concrete valuation.
