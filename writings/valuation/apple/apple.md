# Apple

<div class='straits'>
I’ve recently taken the plunge into the murky waters of the stock market. One of the first companies that I wanted to look at as a serious investment was Apple. Apple initially caught my eye since I realised I am an exceptionally loyal customer of theirs and I figured if I could invest so much into their phones and computers, I should definitely take a look at their stock. There were two other reasons I wanted to look at Apple as the potential first entrant in my portfolio.Firstly, Apple is the largest company in the world overflowing with cash and unlikely to fail, and at the same time it is one of the biggest players in the dynamic technology sector. Combining these two, it seems like Apple would be a nice moderate blend of risk and reward for a meager graduate student. Here, I attempt to piece together a story for where I think the company is heading and translate that into a concrete valuation.

## The Short Story

As of this writing (Dec. 2020), Apple sits snugly on a $2T market valuation, making it the largest company in the world. It had what could be called the most innovative period for a company with its iPod, iPhone, and iPad launch. The iPhone in particular was a major disruptive force that changed the market and brought the term smartphone into the mainstream. This amazing innovation is what led Apple to its stellar current valuation.

Today, however, Apple is a different company. It has transitioned from a disruptor to a more mature company in a steady state. Ever since the iPad launched in 2012, the company has not released any new product with the same disruptive capability of the iPod, iPad, and iPhone. Its business model focuses primarily on releasing new upgraded versions of these and the Mac annually and rely on its superior brand power to keep and attract new customers.  In recent years, however, it has tried to innovate with new operations in accessories - like Apple Watch - and services like Apple Music. Apple saw robust results even through covid, breaking revenue records in multiple quarters. This suggests that the core of its business is still as strong as ever.

## Where Does the Money Come From?

Let’s start our deeper look with a breakdown of Apple’s revenue by its products. Looking at Apple’s 2020 10-K, we see that its five primary segments are: iPhone, Mac, iPad, Accessories, and Services. Looking at their contributions to total revenue, we see that the iPhone is by far the most important product for Apple, accounting for half
its revenue.
