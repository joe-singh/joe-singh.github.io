# Apple

<div class='straits'>
I’ve recently taken the plunge into the murky waters of the stock market. One of the first companies that I wanted to look at as a serious investment was Apple. Apple initially caught my eye since I realised I am an exceptionally loyal customer of theirs and I figured if I could invest so much into their phones and computers, I should definitely take a look at their stock. There were two other reasons I wanted to look at Apple as the potential first entrant in my portfolio. Firstly, Apple is the largest company in the world overflowing with cash and unlikely to fail, and at the same time it is one of the biggest players in the dynamic technology sector. Combining these two, it seems like Apple would be a nice moderate blend of risk and reward for a meager graduate student. Here, I attempt to piece together a story for where I think the company is heading and translate that into a concrete valuation.

## The Short Story
<div id="shortstory" class='straits'>
As of this writing (Dec. 2020), Apple sits snugly on a $2T market valuation, making it the largest company in the world. It had what could be called the most innovative period for a company with its iPod, iPhone, and iPad launch. The iPhone in particular was a major disruptive force that changed the market and brought the term smartphone into the mainstream. This amazing innovation is what led Apple to its stellar current valuation.

Today, however, Apple is a different company. It has transitioned from a disruptor to a more mature company in a steady state. Ever since the iPad launched in 2012, the company has not released any new product with the same disruptive capability of the iPod, iPad, and iPhone. Its business model focuses primarily on releasing new upgraded versions of these and the Mac annually and rely on its superior brand power to keep and attract new customers.  In recent years, however, it has tried to innovate with new operations in accessories - like Apple Watch - and services like Apple Music. Apple saw robust results even through covid, breaking revenue records in multiple quarters. This suggests that the core of its business is still as strong as ever.

## Where Does the Money Come From?
<div id="wheremoney" class='straits'>
Let’s start our deeper look with a breakdown of Apple’s revenue by its products. Looking at Apple’s 2020 10-K, we see that its five primary segments are: iPhone, Mac, iPad, Accessories, and Services. Looking at their contributions to total revenue, we see that the iPhone is by far the most important product for Apple, accounting for half
its revenue.

Interestingly, iPad and Mac sales are the two smallest components of the pie coming in at 9 and 10% respectively. They are overtaken by the services and accessories segment. Services includes things such as App Store sales, iCloud storage, and Apple’s new services suite it has launched which I will address more later. The accessories sector includes products such as AirPods, Apple Watch, and Beats headphones.

<div id="core" class='straits'>
One advantage of analysing a mature company is that there is plenty of history to base a first guess on where the company might be headed. The two plots below show the evolution of how different products have contributed to Apple’s revenues. The left shows what percentage of revenue each sector contributes while the right chart shows how much money each sector brings in on absolute terms. The first big thing to note here is that although iPhones form the largest slice of the Apple pie, they are slowly shrinking in relative importance. In 2016, the iPhone was above 60% of revenues and it has come down to 50% over 5 years, a decline of about 2%.

<div class='straits'>
On the left plot, we see that the amount of money the iPhone brings hasn’t actually changed that much over this period, which means that the decline in relative size must be because other sectors are getting larger and not because the iPhone is itself making less money. This is a good sign, since it shows Apple is trying new things while its old reliable workhorse is still performing consistently. It’s experimenting from a secure location and can afford to fail. The iPhone is a mature product and is not going to disrupt any market. In recent years, the extent of modifications to the iPhone include 5G capability, ever more powerful cameras, and larger screens. Important, but not revolutionary updates. Moreover, Apple faces <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271496/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-vendors-since-4th-quarter-2009/">stiff competition in the smartphone market</a> so margins have likely reached a stable equilibrium or will decline due to competition. Given this, I expect the iPhone to continue its 1-2% revenue growth rate for the foreseeable future.
</div><br>
<div class='straits'>
The Mac and iPad sectors have been consistently less important to the Apple story. Mac has hovered around 10% of revenues and iPad slightly less. These also seem to have reached a stability since there has not been any major disruptive development with these products. These products don’t bring in such huge revenue as the iPhone, so the scope is there for slightly higher growth. I see their revenues continue to grow at past rates of 3-5%.

<div class="straits">
The real wild card here will be the services and accessories divisions. Let’s address services first since it’s the second largest chunk of the pie. The 10-K breaks services down into 5 sections: advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, digital content, and payments. The picture below shows the breakdown of services by revenue.

Advertising notably includes the huge licensing fees that Apple gets from Google to be its default search engine, around <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/apple-services-success-story-bolstered-by-huge-google-payments.html">$8-12 billion</a>, meaning that more than 10% of Apple’s services revenue comes from a single customer. Antitrust regulators have also begun to investigate Google’s payments to Apple as an unfair tactic to suppress competition, making this a potential risk factor.
