# The Mamba Mentality

Kobe Bryant capped off his Hall of Fame career by scoring 60 points against the Utah Jazz at home. He did so in
exactly 50 field goal attempts. In this respect, that last game serves as a perfect microcosm of Kobe’s 20 seasons
in the league; an elite scorer unmatched by anyone at his prime, and an unabashed gunslinger never hesitant to
let it fly from almost anywhere on the court. It was no coincidence that Kobe was the highest volume perimeter
shooter in the history of the game with 26200 attempts, surpassed only by elite inside players Karl Malone (26210)
and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (28307). It is, therefore, instructive to take a closer look at Kobe’s shot selection
patterns and their results. In particular we will address the question of the hot hand, the idea that field goal
percentage increases following a hot streak of made shots. Via a Markov Chain Model, we demonstrate that past
shots had little notable effect on Kobe’s percentages. In this way, we argue that Kobe Bryant’s confidence was a
manifestation of the memoryless property of his shooting.
