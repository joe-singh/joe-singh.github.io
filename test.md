| “Tourist or Resident?”<br>The immigration officer’s question was routine but it caught me off guard. After a 15 hour circumpolar flight in the middle of a pandemic, all I could think of was finally going home. It had been almost two years since I had seen my parents and the house that I had spent much of my childhood in. After two years stuck alone on the other side of the world, it was a relief to finally be home.<br>“Tourist.”  | “Hospes aut Incola?”<br>Rogatio magistrati fuit ordinaria sed paratus non fui ad respondendum. Post volatus XV horarum circum polum arcticum in medio magnae pestilentiae modo domum putabam. Per duos annos parentes meos familiamque meam non viseram. Nam post duos annos in latere altero mundi domum redibam laetus eram. <br> “Hospes.” |
