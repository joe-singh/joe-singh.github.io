I spend a fair bit of time thinking about things that are not physics. During COVID, 
my daydreaming got to
the point where I thought it might be a good idea to commit something to
writing. Writing forces us to refine our scattered thoughts into a
coherent argument that actually makes sense.
It also lets us look back years from now and
maybe comment on what fools we were back in the day.
