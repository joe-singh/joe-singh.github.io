# Thoughts

I spend a fair bit of time thinking about things that are not physics. It got to
the point where I thought it might be a good idea to commit some of these to
writing. Writing allows to refine scattered thoughts in the brain into a
coherent argument. It will also let me look back years from now and
maybe comment on what a fool I was in my youth.
