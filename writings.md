I spend a fair bit of time thinking about things that are not physics. Eventually,
my daydreaming got to
the point where I thought it might be a good idea to commit something to
writing. Writing is great since it forces me to refine my scattered thoughts into a
coherent argument that actually makes sense.
It will also let me look back years from now and
comment on what a fool I used to be.
