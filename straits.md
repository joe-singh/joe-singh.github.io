# Strait To The Point - A Geopolitics Diary

Welcome to a small corner of the internet where I stash my thoughts on what's happening in the world. It may sound
clich√©, but we do live in very interesting times. The post Cold War liberal world order is appearing to crack at the seams
as longterm geopolitical trends, such as the backlash against globalisation and rise of China, come to maturity. The folks over at Eurasia Group
have come up with a great expression for this -- [The Geopolitical Recession](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2017). 

In this uncertain time, the importance of geopolitics has made itself apparent once again. Here, I aim to outline some of the key trends
that are taking place that shape the trajectory of global events, with particular focus on how geographical factors such influence 
events. This blog was inspired in part due tio my having lived a majority of my life in the geopolitically central Indian Ocean region, and a 
majority of that majority living right by the critical chokepoints at the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca, which allowed me to witness the impact of
geopolitics up close. I have a particular soft spot for the Eurasian landmass (especially anything to do with the stans) 
and the Indian Ocean, which I will spend most of my time writing about. I was finally driven to put my thoughts to words after a brief
but insightful conversation with a retired four star admiral at the [Hoover Institution](https://www.hoover.org/), which illustrated the importance of a geostrategic mindset
in tackling the challenges of the 21st century.  

A quick note: Opinions expressed here are my own. I try to be factually correct but perfection is alas inevitable -- if I've got
something wrong let me know by [email](mailto:joe_singh@hotmail.co.uk).
