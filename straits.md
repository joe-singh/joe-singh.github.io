# Strait To The Point - A Geopolitics Diary

Welcome to a small corner of the internet where I stash my thoughts on what's happening in the world. It may sound
clich√©, but we do live in very interesting times. The post Cold War liberal world order is appearing to crack at the seams
as longterm geopolitical trends, such as the backlash against globalisation and rise of China, come to maturity. The folks over at Eurasia Group
have come up with a great expression for this -- [The Geopolitical Recession](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2017). 


A quick note: Opinions expressed here are my own. I try to be factually correct but perfection is alas inevitable -- if I've got
something wrong let me know by [email](mailto:joe_singh@hotmail.co.uk).
