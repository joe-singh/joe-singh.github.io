# Strait Cash - A Geopolitics Diary

Welcome to Strait Cash, a small corner of the internet where I stash my thoughts on what's happening in the world. It may sound
clich√©, but we do live in very interesting times. The post Cold War liberal world order is appearing to crack at the seams
as longterm geopolitical trends, such as the backlash against globalisation and rise of China, come to maturity. The folks over at Eurasia Group
have come up with a great expression for this -- [The Geopolitical Recession](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2017). 

This is mainly intended to be a record of my thoughts on the important developments that occur virtually weekly these days. The name
is inspired by two of the places where I have lived, Dubai and Singapore, which owe their significant wealth and rapid development to their 
proximity to the two most important waterways in the world -- the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca respectively.

A quick note: Opinions expressed here are solely my own. I try to be factually correct but perfection is alas inevitable -- if I've got
something wrong let me know by [email](mailto:joe_singh@hotmail.co.uk).
