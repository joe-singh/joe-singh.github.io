# Translations

A lot of my time is spent thinking about/in other languages. Learning a new
language is a fascinating exercise. On one hand, it is incredible to see
the same ideas expressed with a totally different syntactic structure, much like
the same physics can be expressed in any choice of linear basis. Furthermore,
just as the right choice of basis can make a terribly complicated physics
problem appear beautifully simple, a new language can provide a different
perspective on the world.

Reading and translating texts is one of the ways I try to make a language
come to life beyond just bookish verb conjugations and noun declensions.
It is a fabulous method to get insight into a new culture in its own words.
