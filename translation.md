# Translations

A lot of my time is spent thinking about/in other languages. It is incredible to see
the same ideas expressed in totally different words and grammar which bring different
details of the subject to life. It's like how the same physics can be expressed in any 
choice of basis but expressing the problem in a certain bases just makes the 
fundamental physics so clear and obvious. Just as the right choice of basis can make a terribly complicated physics
problem appear beautifully simple, a new language can provide a different
perspective on the world.

Reading and translating texts is one of the ways I try to make a language
come to life. 
It is also a fabulous method to get insight into a new culture in its own words.
My translations are definitely far from perfect, but I have tried my hardest
to do justice to the fabulous texts I have had the privilege to read.

If you spot mistakes, please let me know!
