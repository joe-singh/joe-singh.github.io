## TL;DR

1. Ever since the industrial revolution, humans have become very bad at breathing, which has had huge negative effects on our health.
2. The fundamental changes we need to make are simple: breathe from the nose, exhale deeply, breathe slowly, breathe less, and chew more. 
3. The “perfect” breath is 5.5 seconds of inhalation and exhalation with 5.5L of air intake. This breathing pattern is a feature of prayer chants in many religions of the world.
4. We can also harness the power of breathing to achieve results beyond just good health, such as increasing endurance and better mental health.

Breathing is one of the most fundamental acts for living organisms, but humans are doing it all wrong - or so claims James Nestor in his insightful book Breath. Nestor says that “as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences”. In Breath, he lays out what led him to this depressing conclusion, and how we can undo the damage of our terrible breathing habits.
