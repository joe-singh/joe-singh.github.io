One of the most notable economic consequences of the pandemic last year was the steep drop in interest rates. Terrified by the prospect of a total meltdown, the Federal Reserve adopted a “whatever it takes” stance to ensure liquidity in the market. As rates dropped and liquidity poured in, 2020 turned out to be a blockbuster year for markets. After the initial crash, the S&P 500 has rebounded with a stellar 74% rise from the March 2020 lows. The tech heavy NASDAQ and small cap Russell 2000 indices were even more impressive, rising by over 100% each from their lows. 2020 was a great year for stocks, but it was a tremendous year for tech and growth in particular.
