# *Shâhnâme-Nâme* 

Hello and welcome to *Shâhnâme-Nâme* my Shahnameh blog. As you might have read on the homepage, I'm quite interested in Turko-Persian history and so it's one of my longstanding goals
to be able to read the Shahnameh in Persian. The [*Shahnameh*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh) or Book of Kings was written by the poet Ferdowsi in the 
10-11th centuries and details Persian legends/history from prehistory to the fall of the Sassanid Empire. It is regarded as a masterpiece across the world and is foundational to the culture of *Iranzamin* or Greater Iran. The Shahnameh in one form or
another is celebrated by Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and is influential in the Caucasus and Central Asia also. Most sources put the it as one of the longest 
epic poems in history.

Although reading it in Persian is unfortunately not feasible (yet!!) I found a wonderful podcast by Amir Khadem called [Reading Ferdowsi](https://readingferdowsi.com/) which presents
the Shahnameh story by story. It also offers some commentary to try and parse the beautiful but difficult poetic language and make it easier to understand. As a way to 
practice my Persian, I try to summarise what I am able to understand from the story as well as offer an English translation of my summary for anybody interested. 

Quick note: the â sound is pronounced like the au in aura.
