# About Me


<!--<img style="position:absolute; LEFT:78% " width="205" height="308" src="./goodpic.jpg"> -->
I am a physics PhD student at Stanford University, 
currently working in Prof. Kent Irwin's group as a rotation student in the effort to [detect bosonic dark matter and fabricate new quantum sensors that can 
evade the Standard Quantum Limit.](https://irwinlab.sites.stanford.edu/) 

I did my undergrad work at UC Berkeley with Prof. Gabriel Orebi Gann and Prof. Matt Pyle. Under Prof. Orebi Gann, I did data analysis for the SNO 
experiment and detector analysis for its successor SNO+. My senior thesis focused on precision detection of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons for
future liquid argon scintillator experiments. With Prof. Pyle I was involved in detector R&D for the SuperCDMS experiment as it transitions to 
lower mass DM targets. My work in particular focused on the 0.1 - 1 GeV range. 

Prior to Berkeley, I was raised in Dubai and Singapore and born in New Delhi. I am a huge basketball fan and love reading, especially about history
and geopolitics. When not doing any of the above, I am usually trying to learn a new language - I can speak 5 so far, and am currently trying to learn Latin
as a stepping stone to Sanskrit.  I am also always looking out for amazing 
kebabs, so if you know where to get some or want to discuss physics, you can get in touch with me [here](mailto:joesingh@stanford.edu).

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
