# About Me

I am an incoming physics PhD student at Stanford University interested in experimental high energy physics or cosmology.
More specifically, my interests lie in neutrino experiments and dark matter searches. Recently, I have also developed an interest in 
CMB cosmology due to the wealth of information the CMB contains about neutrinos and dark matter.  

I did my undergrad work at UC Berkeley with Prof. Gabriel Orebi Gann and Prof. Matt Pyle. Under Prof. Orebi Gann, I did data analysis for the SNO 
experiment and detector analysis for its successor SNO+. My senior thesis focused on precision detection of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons for
future liquid argon scintillator experiments. With Prof. Pyle I have been involved in detector R&D for the SuperCDMS experiment as it transitions to 
lower mass DM targets. My work in particular has focused on the 0.1 - 1 GeV range. 

Outside of physics, I like reading, basketball, history, and learning languages. I am bilingual in Hindi and English and can also speak French, Persian, and 
Turkish. Part of this interest stems from an international background -- I was lucky enough to spend 6 years in Delhi, 4 in Singapore, 8 in Dubai, and now around 9-10
in California. Go Bears/Cardinal/Dubs!

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
