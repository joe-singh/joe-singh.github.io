# About Me


<!--<img style="position:absolute; LEFT:78% " width="205" height="308" src="./goodpic.jpg"> -->
<img align="right" src="./dp2.jpg" style="max-width:30%; border-radius:5%; padding-left: 20px;">
I am a third year Physics PhD student at Stanford University advised by Kent Irwin, interested in applying the methods of quantum metrology to enhance searches for axion dark matter. 
My main focus is on building high Q MHz scale electromagnetic resonators, understanding quantum noise in these frequency ranges, and developing new quantum sensors/protocols to evade the standard quantum limit on measurement.

This year, I am also serving on the [Stanford Graduate Student Council](https://assu.stanford.edu/branches/graduate-student-council/gsc-councillors) as the representative for the Natural Sciences.

<!--I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019. My research there included data analysis for the SNO
experiment, detector analysis for its successor SNO+, and detector R&D for the SuperCDMS experiment. My senior thesis focused on precision detection of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons for
future liquid argon scintillator experiments. -->

Previously, I was at UC Berkeley working on neutrinoless double beta decay and
WIMP dark matter detection. Before that, I was born in [Delhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxRxTlkI3gY&ab_channel=NetflixIndia) and raised in [Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uByyHDXlEqM&ab_channel=TropicMonstersTV) & [Dubai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbL9QdWWJzo&ab_channel=Emirates). 

I am a huge basketball fan and love reading, especially about history.
I write a [newsletter](https://jyotirmai.substack.com/) about all the amazing
scientifc breakthroughs happening currently.
This website also hosts [my thoughts on other things, including books I've read.](./writings.md)

I also really like learning new languages.
I pretend to speak [French](./index-fr.md), [Turkish](./index-tr.md), and [Persian](./translation/shahnameh/shahnameh_blog.md). Recently I've tried to extend into ancient languages with
[Latin](./index-lt.md) and [Sanskrit](./translation/gita/gita.md).

You can get in touch with me [here](mailto:joesingh@stanford.edu)
or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SinghJyotirmai).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
