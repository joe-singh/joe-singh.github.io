# About Me


<!--<img style="position:absolute; LEFT:78% " width="205" height="308" src="./goodpic.jpg"> -->
I am a physics PhD student at Stanford University interested in experimental high energy physics or cosmology.
Currently, I am working in Prof. Giorgio Gratta's group as a rotation student in the effort to make [precision measurements of gravity at 
the micron scale.](http://grattalab3.stanford.edu/neutrino/gravity/index.html) 

I did my undergrad work at UC Berkeley with Prof. Gabriel Orebi Gann and Prof. Matt Pyle. Under Prof. Orebi Gann, I did data analysis for the SNO 
experiment and detector analysis for its successor SNO+. My senior thesis focused on precision detection of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons for
future liquid argon scintillator experiments. With Prof. Pyle I have been involved in detector R&D for the SuperCDMS experiment as it transitions to 
lower mass DM targets. My work in particular has focused on the 0.1 - 1 GeV range. 

Outside of physics I'm interested in geopolitics and history. I particularly like to focus on the Indian Ocean region which 
has recently returned to its traditional importance. My historical interests are modern Europe and Perso-Turkic states of Central and South Asia.  

In terms of having a life, I'm a huge basketball fan (go Dubs/Bears/Cardinal!). I am also always looking out for amazing 
kebabs, so if you know where to get some or want to discuss physics, you can get in touch with me [here](mailto:joesingh@stanford.edu).

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
