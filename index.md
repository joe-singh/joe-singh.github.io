# About Me

I am a senior at UC Berkeley, majoring in physics. In the autumn, I will begin my PhD at Stanford University in either experimental high energy/particle 
physics or cosmology. 

More specifically, my interests lie in experiments focused on neutrinos and dark matter searches. More recently, I have also developed an interest in 
CMB cosmology due to the wealth of information the CMB contains about neutrinos and dark matter.  

My undergrad research work was done with Prof. Gabriel Orebi Gann and Prof. Matt Pyle. Under Prof. Orebi Gann, I worked on data analysis for the SNO 
experiment and on detector analysis for its successor SNO+. My senior thesis focuses on precision detection of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons for
future liquid argon scintillator experiments. With Prof. Pyle I have been involved in detector R&D for the SuperCDMS experiment as it transitions to 
lower mass ranges. 

Outside of physics, I like reading, history, and learning languages. I am fluent in Hindi, proficient in French, and conversant in Persian and Turkish.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
