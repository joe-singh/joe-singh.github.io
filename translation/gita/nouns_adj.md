# Nouns & Adjectives

Nouns and Adjectives in Sanskrit are classified by three features: case,
number, and gender.

## Case

Sanskrit is a strongly inflected language. This means that nouns and
adjectives change their form depending on their function in a sentence. The
form that a word takes is called its <em>case</em>.

English words usually don't change their form since we use the word order to
tell us the function. In the sentence "The man sees an elephant",
"The man" is the subject and "an elephant" is the object. Clearly "An
elephant sees the man" does not have the same meaning! The word order is very
important in the meaning of the sentence.

Sanskrit is different. Instead of relying on word order, Sanskrit changes
the form of the word to tell you whether it is the object, the subject, or
something else entirely. We say that Sanskrit inflects its nouns for case.

Suppose I want to say "The man sees an elephant" in Sanskrit. This would be <em>naraḥ paśyati gajam</em>. <em>Naraḥ</em> is the subject form of <em>nara</em>
meaning "man", and <em>gajam</em> is the object form of <em>gaja</em> meaning
elephant. <em>Paśyati</em> means sees.

If we flip the order and say <em>gajam paśyati naraḥ</em>, it does not
change the meaning, since the function of the words is still the same. Elephant is
still in its object form and man is still in its subject. In fact, every
ordering will have the same meaning, as long as the words do not change their
form.

How many cases are there? It depends on the language. English has none as we
mentioned, since it uses word order. German and Greek have four. Russian and
Latin have six. Sanskrit has eight. These are the eight functions a noun can have
in Sanskrit, along with the abbreviation used in this translation to identify it:


|     Name     | Abbreviation |                                      Explanation                                     | Example word: <em>nara</em> |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|  Nominative  |     nom.     |                               This noun is the subject                               |        <em>naraḥ</em>       |
|  Accusative  |     acc.     |                                This noun is the object                               |        <em>naram</em>       |
| Instrumental |     inst.    |                This noun is the instrument by which something is done                |       <em>nareṇa</em>       |
|    Dative    |     dat.     | This noun is the recipient of the action - i.e.  the action is done to/for this noun |       <em>narāya</em>       |
|   Ablative   |     abl.     |    This noun is the origin of the action - i.e.  the action comes from  this noun    |        <em>narāt</em>       |
|   Genitive   |     gen.     |                        This noun is the possessor of something                       |       <em>narasya</em>      |
|   Locative   |     loc.     |            This noun is the location, i.e. something is in or on this noun           |        <em>nare</em>        |
|   Vocative   |     voc.     |                        This noun is being addressed or called                        |        <em>nara</em>        |

Adjectives also change their form, and will be in the same case as the word they
are describing. If we want to say "the great man", we would say
<em>mahān naraḥ</em>. <em>Mahān</em> is the nominative form of <em>mahat</em>
meaning great and agrees with the nominative <em>naraḥ</em>. If however we want
to say for the great man, we would say <em>mahate narāya</em>, with both
words in their dative form.

## Number

Sanskrit nouns and adjectives have three numbers: singular, plural, and dual.
Modern languages typically have only singular and plural nouns, but some such as
Arabic also have a dual. As the name suggests, the dual is a form used when
referring to two of something. Let's see how our sample word <em>nara</em>
behaves in its singular, dual, and plural forms.

|     Case     | Singular |    Dual   |   Plural  |
|:------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|  Nominative  |   naraḥ  |   narau   |   narāḥ   |
|  Accusative  |   naram  |   narau   |   narān   |
| Instrumental |  nareṇa  | narābhyām |   naraiḥ  |
|    Dative    |  narāya  | narābhyām | narebhyaḥ |
|   Ablative   |   narāt  | narābhyām | narebhyaḥ |
|   Genitive   |  narasya |  narayoḥ  |  narāṇām  |
|   Locative   |   nare   |  narayoḥ  |   nareṣu  |
|   Vocative   |   nara   |   narau   |   narāḥ   |

The labels used in the translation to signify number are **sg**,
**dual**, and **pl**.

Just as with case, adjectives have to agree with the number of the word
they describe. We saw above <em>mahān naraḥ</em> is great man. Great men
would be <em>mahanto narāḥ</em>. Similarly, while for the great man was
<em>mahate narāya</em>, for the great men is <em>mahadbhyo narebhyaḥ</em> \*.

Unlike in English, adjectives and the words they describe don't technically
need to be next to each other in sentences. For example, if we want to say
the elephant (<em>gaja</em>) sees the great man, we could say

<p align="center">
<em>gajaḥ paśyati <span style="color:blue">mahantaṃ naram</span></em>
</p>

But we could also say

<p align="center">
<em><span style="color:blue">mahantaṃ</span> gajaḥ paśyati <span style="color:blue">naram</span></em>
</p>

Since <em>mahantaṃ</em> is an accusative form it must agree with an accusative noun.
In this sentence only <em>naram</em> meets that condition so we know it must agree with that,
independent of where it is in the sentence. This once again shows how flexible word order
is in Sanskrit compared with English.
