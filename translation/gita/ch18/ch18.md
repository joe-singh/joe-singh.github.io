## Ch. 18: मोक्षसंन्यासयोग - <em> Mokṣasaṃnyāsayoga </em> - The Perfection of Renunciation

* [Verse 18.1](./v18-1.md) <br>
<em>Arjuna said: O great armed one, I wish to learn the truth of renunciation and abandonment separately, O bright haired one, killer of the Keshi demon.</em>
* [Verse 18.2](./v18-2.md) <br>
<em>The Blessed One said: The seers say saṃnyāsa is the renunciation of acts of desire. The clear eyed call the abandonment of all fruits of action tyāga.</em>
* [Verse 18.3](./v18-3.md) <br>
<em>Some learned men say action is to be abandoned as evil. Others say that worship, charity, and austerity are not to be abandoned.</em>
* [Verse 18.4](./v18-4.md) <br>
<em>O best of Bharatas, hear My conclusion about abandonment . O tiger among men, abandonment is designated to be threefold.</em>
* [Verse 18.5](./v18-5.md) <br>
<em>Actions of austerity, worship, and charity are not to be abandoned. Indeed that is to be done. Worship, charity, and austerity are purifying for the wise.</em>
* [Verse 18.6](./v18-6.md) <br>
<em>Certainly these actions are to be done without attachment and expectation of result.
This is My supreme opinion O son of Pṛtha.</em>
* [Verse 18.7](./v18-7.md) <br>
<em>But renunciation of prescribed action is not proper. Such delusional renunciation
is declared to be in the mode of ignorance.</em>
* [Verse 18.8](./v18-8.md) <br>
<em>He who should abandon work which is sorrowful or from fear of bodily suffering
has performed abandonment in the mode of passion. He will not attain the fruit
of renunciation.</em>
* [Verse 18.9](./v18-9.md) <br>
<em>When action which is done because it must be done and is a duty, Arjuna, and
when attachment and the fruit of action has been abandoned, such renunciation
is considered to be in the mode of goodness.</em>
* [Verse 18.10](./v18-10.md) <br>
<em>The wise renouncer who neither hates the inauspicious nor is attached to the auspicious
is filled with goodness.</em>
* [Verse 18.11](./v18-11.md) <br>
<em>Certainly an embodied being cannot abandon action entirely.
He who abandons the fruit of action however is called a man of renunciation. </em>
